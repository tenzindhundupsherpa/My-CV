				<p>Web development is the process of developing a web based application and creating websites. Web based applications are generally all the application that are run in a web browsers while the websites are the collection of webpages which are linked to each other and are accesible through website homepage by using different browser like GoogleChrome, Safari, et cetera. Webpages are created in order to share the message or informartion throughout the world. The webpages are commonly written in HyperText matkup Languate which can be access from a internet. So the task for our first term was also creating a webpages which provides audience information about ourself and our experinces. For the task, six different pages were to create containing different contents. The first pages to create was the landing pages or homepages which should be made live by pushing its code to github. Through this page a user can visit linked pages. So in this way six different pages were created and the final CV website is developed.</p>

				User Interface Design (UI) is the design of user interfaces which focus on maximizing usability and the user experience on a website. User interface design helps to make the user's interaction as simple and efficient as possible. Attractive design can make the website looks great, but a better UI makes user experience smooth and great performance. A good UI makes the user easily able to navigate their way to different pages of websites. A good UI should make the audience feels like they are using their own creation, user doesn't find it hard to get throughout the pages. So, the better the User Interface, the better the user can use it and the more they use it if it is easier to use. Also, the better the user interfaces are the more the audiences will like to use it. Since we are making a website which gives information about ourselves and our experiences, in order to design the best possible User Interface(UI) for my website, I have searched for different design and finally taken a reference from one of the online template and its' screenshot is given below too. After going over different design style and discussion with Friends, I found this template goes well with the trends and the interface in it seems very simple. In this template, one can easily navigate throughout the website and get what they are looking for of the creators. The contents in the website can be easily accessed by clicking their links. Though the content in it seems very minimal, it can give lot of details about one personality and style.

				<p> Developing a website was one of my career goal. I have learned to code basic HTML from my school time and learned about CSS after completing high school. I could design simple website layout which would be more like a plain text file without any effects and designing. But with the teaching that I have received in NAMI for this six months made me able to code more advance HTML and CSS. In this six months’ time, I just didn’t learn about what code to code and how to code but I learned how the code would work and how it could change the webpages. I have learned about the importance of responsive web designing and why in the web-developers world 2018 is called mobile first design. I found the tutors in NAMI very helpful and the teaching here is more practical and would follow the global trends of web development helping students to code new and updated HTML and CSS code. After this six months, now I believe that I can create a responsive website with the proper HTML and CSS code. I can design as per the current trends featuring different effects like Transition and Animation. Now I can add different visual effects into my website. </p>

				The flex box model is used to display the section parts in a row of index page. The source code for flex is shown below.
