				<p>"Internet" is the word that you can hear from everyone, even from the mouth of child these days. The Internet has taken over the world and everyone needs Internet these days. According to Stephan Hawking(2018)"We are all now connected by the Internet, like neurons in a giant brain".</p>

				<p>User Interface Design (UI) is the design of user interfaces which focus on maximizing usability and the user experience on a website. User interface design helps to make the user's interaction as simple and efficient as possible. For the User Interface(UI) of my webiste, I have taken a references from the given below template screenshot. After going over different design style and discussion with Friends, I found this template goes well with the trends and though the content in it is very minimal, it can give lot details about one personality and style. In this template, one can easily navigate what they want to look. The contents can be easily accessed by clicking their links. The design is responsive as per the device types.

				<p> Developing a website was one of my career goal. I have learned to code basic HTML from my school time and learned about CSS after completing high school. I could design simple website layout which would be more like a plain text file without any effects and designing. But with the teaching that I have received in NAMI for this six months made me able to code more advance HTML and CSS. In this six months’ time, I just didn’t learn about what code to code and how to code but I learned how the code would work and how it could change the webpages. I have learned about the importance of responsive web designing and I didn't even know about the code validation until I got here in NAMI. The teaching here is more practical and would follow the global trends of web development helping students to code new and updated HTML and CSS code. After this six months, now I believe that I can create a responsive website with the proper HTML and CSS code. I can design as per the current trends featuring different effects like Transition and Animation.</p>
